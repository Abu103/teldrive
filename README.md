> [!IMPORTANT]

## Best Practices for Using Teldrive

### Dos:

- **Follow Limits:** Adhere to the limits imposed by Telegram servers to avoid account bans and automatic deletion of your channel. Your files will be removed from telegram servers if you try to abuse the service.
- **Responsible Storage:** Be mindful of the content you store on Telegram. Utilize storage efficiently and only keep data that serves a purpose.
- **Use Encryption:** For sensitive files, utilize the built-in encryption feature to ensure data security.
- **Monitor Upload Progress:** Keep an eye on the status messages during uploads to ensure successful file transfer.
  
### Don'ts:
- **Data Hoarding:** Avoid excessive data hoarding, as it not only violates Telegram's terms.
- **Ignore Upload Status:** Don't ignore upload status messages as they provide important feedback about the upload process.
  
By following these guidelines, you contribute to the responsible and effective use of Telegram, maintaining a fair and equitable environment for all users.
